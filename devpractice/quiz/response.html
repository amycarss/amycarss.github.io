        <h2>Here's why</h2>
        <h2>Inclusive language: Faculty</h2>

       <p> Please be aware when you use the term faculty, it should be inclusive of all people classified as faculty. This includes:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Tenure-track faculty (tenured, tenure-track)</li>
           <li>Research-track faculty (research professors, research scientists, research investigators)</li>
           <li>Lecturers</li>
           <li>Professors of practice (clinical professors)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Faculty is an inclusive term. Department websites present a very visible opportunity to reinforce inclusiveness, but this guideline should apply to all communications. So whenever you type the word “faculty,” stop for a moment and think about what you mean. </p>
        
       <p><img src="assets/check.png" id="check"> All four subcategories are included within “Faculty”.</p> 
       <img src="assets/navimage.png" id="nav-example"/>
        Avoid using “faculty” when any of the four groups is excluded, and instead specify which groups you mean.

<h3>Core Faculty</h3>
<p>Also, be careful about using the label “Core” as it relates to faculty. “Core” should not be used to distinguish one faculty group from another (for example, referring to only tenure-track faculty as Core Faculty and grouping them apart from Research Faculty and Lecturers). 

“Core” should relate to a faculty member’s level of appointment or activity within a department. (So, for example, a faculty member with a dry appointment might not be listed among Core Faculty, but a lecturer who teaches exclusively within your department would.)</p>
