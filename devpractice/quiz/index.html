           <h3>Here's why it matters</h3>
           <h2>Inclusive language: Faculty</h2>

       <p> Please be aware when you use the term faculty, it should be inclusive of <span class="emphasize">everyone the university classifies as faculty</span>. This includes:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><span class="emphasize">Tenure-track faculty</span> (tenured, tenure-track)</li>
           <li><span class="emphasize">Research-track faculty</span> (research professors, research scientists, research investigators)</li>
           <li><span class="emphasize">Lecturers</span></li>
           <li><span class="emphasize">Professors of practice</span> (clinical professors)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Faculty is an inclusive term. Department websites present a very visible opportunity to reinforce inclusiveness, but this guideline should apply to all communications. So whenever you type the word “faculty,” stop for a moment and think about what you mean. </p>
        
       <p><img src="assets/check.png" class="shrink" alt=""> CORRECT: All subcategories are included within “Faculty”.</p> 
       <img src="assets/navimage.jpg" id="nav-example" alt="navigation example showing all faculty types included under faculty heading"/>
        <p>Avoid using “faculty” when any of the four groups is excluded, and instead specify which groups you mean.</p>

<h3>Core Faculty</h3>
<p>Also, be careful about using the label “Core” as it relates to faculty. “Core” should not be used to distinguish one faculty group from another (for example, referring to only tenure-track faculty as Core Faculty and grouping them apart from Research Faculty and Lecturers). 

“Core” should relate to a faculty member’s level of appointment or activity within a department. (So, for example, a faculty member with a dry appointment might not be listed among Core Faculty, but a lecturer who teaches exclusively within your department would.)</p>
