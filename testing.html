       <h1>Tech and Testing</h1> 
        <p>It’s not just about making things; it’s about making things better - or faster, easier, less expensive. That’s what happens when you concentrate talent and creativity around the right resources. </p>

        <p>Mcity, a public-private partnership headquartered in the U-M Office of Research and by now a household name among Michigan Engineers – has become a hub at the university. It counts among its major investors Aptiv, Denso, Econolite, Ford, GM, Honda, Intel, LG, StateFarm, Toyota and Verizon.</p>  
        
        <h2>Lidar on a Budget</h2>
        <h3>Toyota Research Institute - Ann Arbor</h3>
        <p><img src="images/lidar.jpg" alt="man adjusting lidar unit on top of car"/>Lidar units, which work with cameras and radar to pinpoint an autonomous vehicle’s location, can cost up to $70,000, and can wear out quickly. So researchers at the Toyota Research Institute - Ann Arbor adapted video game technology to turn pre-recorded maps into 3D visualizations that accomplish the same goal, but do it using inexpensive cameras.</p>
        
        <h2>Deep Learning Hack</h2>
        <h3>U-M/Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles, Ann Arbor</h3>
        <p><img src="images/gta.jpg" alt="scene from Grand Theft Auto video game"/>The deep learning datasets that train autonomous systems are typically annotated by humans before they’re fed to a computer - a slow and painstaking process. A team at  U-M/Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles discovered that Grand Theft Auto looks enough like the real world to train a system. They were able to develop automated image annotation algorithms and then, overnight, extract and mark up ten million scenes, which they used to improve the accuracy of their system. </p>
        
        
        
        <h2>Cars that Think</h2>
        <h3>May Mobility, Ann Arbor</h3>
        <p><img src="images/signs.jpg" alt="road signs next to traffic circle"/>Path planning has typically relied on loading a vehicle with lots and lots of data so it knows where to expect certain features - like trees and traffic signals. But U-M is also the birthplace of a radically different technique known as multi-policy decision making. In this approach, the vehicle doesn’t plan a path at all – it uses a library of driving strategies and runs a real-time “election” to pick the best one for a particular situation. The team at May Mobility, which operates a fleet of autonomous shuttles in Detroit, is pushing this technology to produce increasingly human-like behavior.</p>
        
        
        
       <h2>Weather Dependent</h2> 
        <h3>Mcity, Ann Arbor</h3>
        <p><img src="images/snowy.jpg" alt="view through windshield as car drives in falling snow"/>Rain and snow can cloud driverless car perception systems just like they cloud your vision. So Ford Motor Company turned to the Mcity Test Facility to evaluate its algorithms in winter weather. That’s an example of the kind of work that’s possible in this first-of-its-kind proving ground. At the test facility, industry and faculty researchers can put their vehicles through potentially dangerous situations that self-driving cars must master before they can take the place of human drivers.</p>
        
        <h2>From Prototype to Product</h2>
        <h3>American Center for Mobility, Ypsilanti</h3>
        <p><img src="images/driverless-ahead.jpg" src="road sign indicating driverless cars ahead"/>Technology that’s graduating from prototype to product can take the next steps at the American Center for Mobility at Willow Run in Ypsilanti. ACM’s 530-acre campus hosts a 2.5-mile, 80 mph highway loop, multi-decker bridges, tunnels and a full-scale boulevard designed with the Michigan Department of Transportation’s help.</p> 
        <p><q>It is the real world,</q> said John Maddox, president and CEO. <q>For the verification and validation aspects we’re focusing on, that’s what you need. If you want to operate your vehicle on a highway, you have to teach it on a highway. Otherwise, you haven’t taught it.</q></p>
        
        
        <h2>Road Ready</h2>
        <h3>U.S. 23</h3>
        <p><img src="images/traffic.jpg" alt="Four lane highway filled with cars"/>In June 2018 the state of Michigan opened the third lane of 13 miles of US 23 for connected and autonomous vehicles, and added $2 million in infrastructure for data collection.</p>
