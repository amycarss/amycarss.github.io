<h1 class="entry-title">Summary of Lecturer Appointments</h1> <div class="entry-content"> <p>Lecturer Appointments at the University of Michigan are subject to&nbsp;the terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement between the University of Michigan and the Lecturers’ employee organization (LEO) AFT/MFT and SRP Local 6244 AFL-CIO.</p> <p>The Lecturer title is used for any non-tenure-track faculty member that is engaged in teaching University of Michigan students for University of Michigan credit as the instructor of record or with responsibility for grading student products in the course.</p> <p>There are four Lecturer title series’ which may be used, depending upon the relationship of the individual with the University, the time frame of the teaching appointment (once semester per academic year vs. every semester), and the duties of the position.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The Lecturer I/II</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><br />The Lecturer I appointment is primarily for the teaching (and its related duties) of assigned courses. There is no requirement&nbsp;of any additional duties or responsibilities with this appointment. By mutual agreement between the Lecturer I and the academic unit, the Lecturer I may on an occasional basis preform additional duties or responsibilities. These additional duties may or may not be for&nbsp;compensation and may or may not be considered in the review process. The Lecturer I/II typically teaches both Fall and Winter semesters on a regular basis.&nbsp; The Lecturer I title is a probationary title from which the Lecturer may be promoted to the title of Lecturer II through the successful completion of the Major Review. Once in the Lecturer II title, the Lecturer remains within this title through successive Major Reviews.&nbsp; There is no promotional path into the Lecturer III/IV title series.</p> <p><strong>Lecturer III/IV</strong><br />The Lecturer III appointment is for a position that includes instruction and significant ongoing administrative or service duties within the academic unit, and/or requires a range of instructional expertise.&nbsp; The Lecturer III/IV typically teaches both&nbsp;Fall and Winter semesters on a regular basis. The creation of a Lecturer III position involves a request to the ADAA office and Executive Committee approval.&nbsp; This is a probationary title from which the Lecturer may be promoted to the title of Lecturer IV through the successful completion of the Major Review.&nbsp; Once in the Lecturer IV title, the Lecturer remains within this title through successive Major Reviews. There is no further promotional path.</p> <p><strong>Intermittent Lecturer<br /></strong>The Intermittent Lecturer is comparable to a Lecturer I, except that s/he teaches on an intermittent basis, one or more regularly occurring courses, but only one semester or less per academic year. Intermittent Lecturers may, upon written request, undergo a review after the sixth consecutive year of service.&nbsp; If the review is successful, the Intermittent Lecturer retains the same title and receives the raise associated with the completion of a Major Review for Lecturers&nbsp;I/II/III/IV&nbsp;(currently 7%).&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Adjunct Lecturer, Adjunct Assistant Professor, Adjunct Associate Professor, Adjunct Professor<br /></strong>University employees who hold a regular non-instructional title at 50% or greater and who are appointed to teach a course or courses may be appointed in the adjunct title series provided that the two appointments are interdependent and not separate.&nbsp; Employees in this title series may, upon written request, undergo a review after the sixth year of service.&nbsp; If successful, the employee receives a lump-sum payment (currently $7%).</p> <h4>Other topics related to Lecturer appointments:</h4> <ul><li> <div> <div><a href="http://adaa.engin.umich.edu/admin/leo/lecturers/">Guidelines for Hiring Lecturers</a></div> </div> </li> <li> <div> <div><a href="http://adaa.engin.umich.edu/admin/rh/draft-offer-letter/">Lecturer Offer Letters</a></div> </div> </li> <li> <div><a href="http://adaa.engin.umich.edu/annrev/">Lecturer Annual Performance Review</a></div> </li> </ul><p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding Lecturer appointments, please feel free to contact Jennifer PIper, Managing Director of Academic Affairs.</p> </div>
