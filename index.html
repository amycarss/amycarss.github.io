        <p>Michigan's New Motor City. That’s what The New York Times called Ann Arbor last year. The city is home to some central pieces of an expanding autonomous vehicle research and development ecosystem that rivals Detroit’s storied leadership in advancing the automobile.</p>
    
        <p>Established firms and startups alike have set up shop in southeast Michigan, lured by a mix of singular testing sites, forward-looking public policy, innovative spirit and a growing pool of engineering talent.</p>
    
        <p><q>The state of Michigan has led the traditional auto industry for the last 120 years, and we’re well positioned to be at the forefront of the next revolution,</q> said Kirk Steudle, director of the Michigan Department of Transportation. <q>We have a lot of assets that play nicely together on a global stage. Ninety-two of the top 100 global auto suppliers have a presence in Michigan. So you can develop and test in other places if you like, but the truth is if you want it on a vehicle or mass produced it’s got to touch Michigan at some point.</q> </p>
