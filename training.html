        <h3>Next-Gen Engineers</h3>

        <p><q>There is a real race for talent,</q> said John Maddox, president and CEO of the American Center for Mobility, or ACM, in Ypsilanti. <q>Many companies have told us they’re looking to hire thousands of engineers over the next couple years globally.</q></p>
        
        <p>In 2015, the state’s Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Task Force surveyed 50 employers in Southeast Michigan about the autonomous vehicle workforce. Their most common need was for “connected systems engineers” – a specialty that includes software engineering, systems engineering and electrical engineering, and pays roughly $90,000 a year.</p>
        
        <p>Several entities in the region are working to establish a pipeline to these high-demand, high-paying jobs. </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>American Center for Mobility, co-founded by U-M,has brought together 15 universities and community colleges to work on the problem</li>
            <li>U-M Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers a master’s degree in Transportation Systems Engineering and a PhD in Next Generation Transportation Systems. </li>
            <li>The U-M Robotics Institute’s master’s and Ph.D. programs are ranked #2 in the nation, and the Institute will soon reside in the new Ford Motor Company Robotics Building</li>
            <li>TechLab, which is run by the Center for Entrepreneurship, gives engineering undergraduates a chance to work with autonomous vehicle startups. </li>
            <li>Center for Connected and Automated Transportation, a consortium of five Midwestern universities and Washtenaw Community College is developing courses and programs to educate tomorrow’s autonomous vehicle workforce</li>
