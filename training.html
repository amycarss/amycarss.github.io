        <h2>Next-Gen Engineers</h2>

        <p><q>There is a real race for talent,</q> said John Maddox, president and CEO of the <a href="http://www.acmwillowrun.org/">American Center for Mobility</a>, or ACM, in Ypsilanti. <q>Many companies have told us they’re looking to hire thousands of engineers over the next couple years globally.</q></p>
        
        <p>In 2015, the state’s Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Task Force surveyed 50 employers in Southeast Michigan about the autonomous vehicle workforce. Their most common need was for “connected systems engineers” – a specialty that includes software engineering, systems engineering and electrical engineering, and pays roughly $90,000 a year.</p>
    </div><!--intro-->
        <p>Several entities in the region are working to establish a pipeline to these high-demand, high-paying jobs. </p>
