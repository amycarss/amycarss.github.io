              <h2>Problem 1: Test Anxiety</h2>
              
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>
                        The stakes are high for standardized test-takers.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The strict, timed nature of tests like the SAT and GRE, combined with their significance in admissions and certification processes, creates a recipe for stress that has little to do with what the test taker knows.  Practice tests can simulate the test questions, but even timed tests fall short of simulating a real testing environment and its many stress triggers.
           
            </p></div>
            
            <div>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>A virtual reality app that allows test takers to practice tests in a simulated testing center could condition them to better cope with this anxiety.</p>

            <div><h3>About the Prototype</h3>
              <p> 
            The prototype is a 360-degree classroom setting from the point of view of a student seated at a desk. It supports the implicit test-day interactions of looking around at the proctor, other students and the clock. These details and interactions help establish immersion. </p>
                <p>The prototype also includes an onboarding prompt, asking the user to choose a test to practice. In a shippable version, this explicit interaction would be followed by the actual practice test.</p>
                <p>We prototyped these interactions, as well as an opening screen prompting the user to choose a testing location, in clay and paper before applying a variety of digital prototyping tools to the task. </p>

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Prototyping this app allowed our team to experiment with available prototyping tools and better understand the prototyping landscape non-developers face. We found Ottifox helpful for quick, high level prototyping and early iteration but also found its available interaction choices fairly limited. It also demands quite a bit of processing and battery power. </p>
<p>A-Frame is more robust and lightweight, but required more time to learn. We were able to build limited interaction with our existing HTML/CSS skills and could do more with this tool with some additional JavaScript experience. Workign with A-Frame provided an opportunity to find answers and apply help from the open source development community.</p>
<p>This project also highlighted the challenges of handling text in a 3D environment, something that would need to be resolved in order to proctor an entire test in the virtual environment.

                <h2>Problem 2: Cosmetic Buyer's Remorse</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Buying cosmetics online is a leap of faith</h3> 
                <p>Beauty products are a very personal purchase, but also a risky one online. Consumers who want to explore new looks do so at the risk of spending money on products that don't look good on them. Although “Try it on” features are part of some mobile apps, the space constraints of a mobile screen make it less than ideal for trying on a multifaceted new look. Most of these apps also require the user to upload a photo of themselves, limiting them to a single static version of their potential look. 
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Our Solution</h3>
                <p>Our team designed an app that would use augmented reality to allow the user to select and virtually try on several different makeup combinations while sitting at their computer. They would see themself in real time on their own monitor (as captured by their webcam). The app leverages an AR marker pattern made up of points on the human face, which allows the "makeup" to move with the user's face.

                <h3>About the Prototype</h3>
                <p>We focused on prototyping the interactions associated with choosing and switching between different makeup looks, a core functionality of our app.</p>
                <p>This digital prototype uses publicly available lenses made with Snapchat Lens Studio. Snap Camera is a service within Lens Studio that allows a user to apply custom lenses to their computer's webcam. With Snap Camera running locally, I used an A-Frame base hosted in Glitch to render worldspace with different makeup looks applied and user interface elements overlayed on the screen.

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Importance of choosing the right type of marker system</li>
                <li>Existing tools are better suited to some AR applications than one might expect. In terms of the intended effect of mapping different makeup looks to the user’s face, this digital prototype came very close to what we’d envisioned and physically prototyped. </li>
                <li>Clarity about which elements of the interaction happen in worldspace and which happen in screen space can make or break an AR design</li>
                </ul>
